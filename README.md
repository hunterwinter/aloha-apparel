##Reflections

The first project for my Full-Time Web Developer Program. Learning Jquery was definitely a challenge. This project was also great practice for styling with CSS3.  Going back to do some final tweaks during portfolio week really opened my eyes to how far I've come as a developer. It also made me realize how much I truly enjoy using SASS.
